title: PyTorch

PyTorch is a fast and flexible neural network framework with an imperative paradigm. It builds neural networks on a tape-based autograd system and provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration . Recurrent neural networks are mostly used in PyTorch for machine translation, classification, text generation, tagging, and other NLP tasks.
