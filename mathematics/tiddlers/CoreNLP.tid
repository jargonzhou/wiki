Stanford's CoreNLP is a flexible, fast, and modern grammatical analysis tool that provides APIs for most common programming languages including Python. It also has an ability to run as a simple web service. As mentioned on the official website, the framework has a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, named entity recognizer (NER), parser, coreference resolution system, sentiment analysis, bootstrapped pattern learning, and open information extraction tools.
