title: Deeplearning4j

Deeplearning4j is a deep learning Java programming library, but it also has a Python API, Keras that will be described below. Distributed CPUs and GPUs, parallel training via iterative reduce, and micro-service architecture adaptation are its main features . Vector space modeling enables the tool to solve text-mining problems. Parts of speech (PoS) tagging, dependency parsing, and word2vec for creating word embedding are discussed in the documentation.
