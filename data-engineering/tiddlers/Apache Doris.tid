title: Apache Doris

<<<.tc-big-quote
Apache Doris is an easy-to-use, high-performance and real-time analytical database based on MPP architecture, known for its extreme speed and ease of use. It only requires a sub-second response time to return query results under massive data and can support not only high-concurrent point query scenarios but also high-throughput complex analysis scenarios.

All this makes Apache Doris an ideal tool for scenarios including report analysis, ad-hoc query, unified data warehouse, and data lake query acceleration. On Apache Doris, users can build various applications, such as user behavior analysis, AB test platform, log retrieval analysis, user portrait analysis, and order analysis.

* XNIO: XNIO is a simplified low-level I/O layer which can be used anywhere you are using NIO today. It frees you from the hassle of dealing with Selectors and the lack of NIO support for multicast sockets and non-socket I/O, while still maintaining all the capabilities present in NIO, and it opens the door to non-obvious optimizations.
