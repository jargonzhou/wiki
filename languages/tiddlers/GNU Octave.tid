<<<.tc-big-quote
Scientific Programming Language

* Powerful ''mathematics-oriented syntax'' with built-in ''2D/3D plotting and visualization tools''
* Free software, runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD, and Microsoft Windows
* Drop-in ''compatible with many Matlab scripts''


GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for ''numerical computations''. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.

Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octaveâ€™s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
